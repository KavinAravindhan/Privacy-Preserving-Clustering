In the contemporary landscape of online social networks, preserving users' privacy while applying clustering techniques is a pivotal concern. This project integrates differential privacy into social network clustering to balance user privacy and clustering effectiveness. Through a detailed exploration of differential privacy parameters, this work provides insights into how privacy levels influence clustering accuracy and offers a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between privacy, data utility, and clustering in social networks.
